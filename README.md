# Machine-Learning-Internship---CodeAlpha-Tasks
This repo contains three ML projects: Credit Scoring Model, Handwritten Character Recognition, and Disease Prediction. Each demonstrates data handling, model training, and evaluation skills using classification algorithms. 

This repository documents the work I accomplished during my machine learning internship, focusing on predictive modeling and pattern recognition. Below is an overview of each project:

## Credit Scoring Model
This project develops a model to predict individual creditworthiness using historical financial data, leveraging classification algorithms and accuracy assessment techniques.

## Handwritten Character Recognition
A system that employs neural networks to recognize handwritten characters and words, demonstrating the adaptability of the model to various handwriting styles.

## Disease Prediction from Medical Data
A predictive model that uses medical records to forecast the likelihood of diseases, showcasing the use of classification algorithms in healthcare analytics.
