# Machine-Learning-Internship CodeAlpha-Tasks

This repository showcases the work I completed during my machine learning internship. Each project in this collection is housed in its directory, complete with detailed Jupyter notebooks and a README for a comprehensive understanding of the methodologies and results.

### Projects Overview:

1. **Credit Scoring Model**:
   - Located in `/Credit_Scoring_Model`
   - This project focuses on developing a predictive model to assess creditworthiness based on historical financial data. It utilizes various classification algorithms and includes an evaluation of the model's accuracy and performance.

2. **Handwritten Character Recognition**:
   - Located in `/Handwritten_Character_Recognition`
   - A deep learning project aimed at creating a recognition system capable of understanding handwritten characters and alphabets. This extends to recognizing entire words and sentences, demonstrating the robustness of the model against diverse handwriting styles.

3. **Disease Prediction from Medical Data**:
   - Located in `/Disease_Prediction`
   - This model predicts the likelihood of diseases based on medical data, such as symptoms and patient history. It processes labeled medical records with classification algorithms to forecast potential health risks.

### Technologies and Skills:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Data cleansing, normalization, and transformation to prepare datasets for analysis.
- **Model Development**: Application of machine learning techniques such as SVM, Random Forest, and neural networks.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Use of metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to assess model efficacy.
- **Visualization**: Creation of insightful plots and charts to represent data and results clearly.
